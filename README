ArtJs is JavaScript framework for building complex web applications. 
It allows you to:
  - select or manipulate DOM elements, 
  - perform AJAX requests, 
  - provides load of helper methods for String, Array, Object, Date and other native classes,
  - provides number of UI elements
  - comes with built in testing framework

Currently it supports FF, Chrome, Safari and IE8 >.

You can download development or minified version of source code.
You only need to include that single file in your head section.

<script src="../javascripts/art-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

It offers two methods for initializing the application:

ArtJs.onDocumentLoad

and

ArtJs.onWindowLoad

Just after library is loaded there are two methods that you may want to use: ArtJs.globalize() and ArtJs.doInjection()

ArtJs.globalize() makes all the classes globally accessible in window object, as well as shorthand utility methods like: $, $P, $B, $D, $DC, $E.

ArtJs.doInjection() makes an extensions on native classes like Object, Array, Date, Element etc. so that you can use:

arr.first();

otherwise you are still able to call the method using:

ArtJs.ArrayUtils.first(arr);

See documentation for more detailed information.
